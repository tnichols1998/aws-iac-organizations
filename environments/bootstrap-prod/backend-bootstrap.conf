# Terraform Backend Configuration for Bootstrap Phase
# 
# This uses local backend for bootstrap since we can't assume S3 exists yet
# The bootstrap phase creates the OIDC provider and IAM roles needed for GitHub Actions
#
# Usage:
#   terraform init (uses local backend by default)

# Note: For production, you might want to use S3 backend after initial setup:
# bucket         = "terraform-state-aws-iac-organizations-bootstrap"
# key            = "bootstrap/terraform.tfstate" 
# region         = "us-west-2"
# encrypt        = true
# dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-bootstrap"

# Terraform Backend Configuration for Development Environment
# 
# For LocalStack development, this uses a local backend
# For AWS development, this uses an S3 backend
#
# Usage:
#   terraform init -backend-config=backend-dev.conf

# S3 Backend Configuration (used when TARGET=aws)
bucket         = "terraform-state-aws-iac-organizations-dev"
key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-west-2"
encrypt        = true
dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-dev"

# Note: When using LocalStack (TARGET=localstack), 
# the backend will automatically use the LocalStack endpoints
# configured in the provider block

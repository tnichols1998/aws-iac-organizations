# 
# For QA environment, this uses local backend for initial setup
# Later can be migrated to S3 backend in the sandbox account
#
# Usage:
#   terraform init -backend-config=backend-qa.conf

# Local Backend Configuration (for initial setup)
# Note: Comment out for S3 backend later:
# bucket         = "terraform-state-aws-iac-organizations-qa"
# key            = "qa/terraform.tfstate"
# region         = "us-west-2"
# encrypt        = true
# dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock-qa"
